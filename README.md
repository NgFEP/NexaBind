# NexaBind

A demo version of the Python user interface for molecular dynamics simulation software package called NexaBind
## Description

NexaBind is the next-generation molecular dynamics simulation software package to predict protein-ligand binding affinities leading to drug discovery. NexaBind is equipped with modern free energy methods, novel sampling algorithms, and parallel programming to support diverse scientific applications.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8 or above
* OS: Windows 10, 11
* Visual Studio 2022 for execution via the source code
* Anaconda for execution via the published version

### Executing program (Source Code)

* Open the tests folder
* Simply run the NexaBindTest.py

### Executing program (Published Version)

* Create a folder containing the 'input.pdb' file and the Python test code 'NexaBindTest.py'. These files can be found inside the tests folder.
* Open the Anaconda environment terminal.
* Install NexaBind via this command: pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ NexaBind==1.0.0
* Go to the directory of the folder you just created and simply run NexaBindTest.py.

## Expected output!

a simple print of:
- "The Forcefield XML file parser class is under construction!
- The Protein PDB file reader class is under construction!
- The Energy Minimizer class is under construction!
- The Report Generator class is under construction!
- The Simulation class is under construction!
- The Back End XmlSerilizer class is under construction!
- The Back End Computaional Kernels are under construction!
